It's been very sunny lately, hasn't it? 
 Yes, it has. Some rain would be very nice. 
 I don't think it will rain for quite some time.
What are you going to do about your death? 
 Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it. 
 I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
My grandma bought me some chocolates yesterday. 
 That is an impressive-looking box. 
 She said they were imported chocolates.
Can you help me find an apartment? 
 Sure, I would be happy to help. 
 I'm having trouble starting my search.
This is Joseph Walters, the inspector. 
 Hello, Joseph. I'm the buyer, Mrs. Smith 
 Hello, Mrs. Smith. I've done a preliminary check of the property.
Doesn't that new Godzilla movie look good? 
 The effects are much better than in the old movies. 
 The storyline sounds interesting, too.
What's this stain? 
 I don't know. 
 It looks like blood.
Where are you going? 
 I have to walk the dog. 
 What kind of dog do you have?
They should increase the voting age to 21. 
 Why do you think they should do that? 
 Well, people can't drink until they're 21.
You look troubled. 
 I feel terrible. 
 What's the problem?
Let's play cards. 
 I don't know any card games. 
 I'll teach you one.
Something's wrong with my computer. 
 Exactly what? 
 All I get is a black screen.
You look lost. Are you in need of any directions? 
 I was just about to ask someone for directions. Thank you for noticing. 
 Where are you from?
You're yawning. 
 I sure am. 
 You should go to bed.
What's wrong? You look sad. 
 I was rejected from my dream school. 
 I'm sorry to hear that.
I was hoping you could help me. 
 I'll try. What help do you need? 
 I'm having an interview tomorrow morning. I'm very nervous.
I'm starving! 
 Me too. Let's get something to eat. 
 What would you like?
That is such a cute dress! 
 Thanks! I bought it yesterday. 
 Have you worn it yet?
Hey Dennis, this is Ron. How's it going? 
 Hi, Ron. I'm looking for a summer job. I was hoping you could help me. 
 Okay, how can I help you?
Mom, are there animals in the forest? 
 Yes, there are many different kinds. 
 Then why haven't we seen any?
I like a window seat! 
 Why are you always so excited about sitting there? 
 I like being able to look outside.
The prices on fruit have really gone up this year! 
 Yes, they have. It's ridiculous! 
 The fruit is not of good quality, either.
We need a new mattress. 
 What's the matter with this one? 
 It's not comfortable.
I have to clean the house. 
 Yes, it's very dirty. 
 You can help me.
Ow! That really hurts! 
 Are you alright? What happened? 
 I accidentally cut myself.
Are you married? 
 No. I'm divorced. 
 When did you get divorced?
My brother smokes three packs a day. 
 Three packs of what? 
 Cigarettes, of course.
Quick! Get in here and wait out the storm! 
 Oh, my word. Thank you so much. 
 It's raining cats and dogs out there.
Hi John, this is Katy. 
 It's so nice to hear your voice. 
 I just wanted to call you and thank you for the lovely time last Friday.
The Beatles are the best. 
 They are the best musical group ever. 
 I love all their songs.
The house down the street is on fire! 
 How do you know? 
 There is smoke coming up from the house!
Does it snow in your hometown? 
 Sometimes, when it's very cold. 
 I've never seen snow. What is it like?
I need a new computer. 
 What's the matter with yours? 
 It's six years old.
Don't read that text message now! 
 Why not? We're in the middle of traffic. 
 It doesn't matter, but it is against the law.
Do you know which bus will get me from Maywood to Cal State LA? 
 Yes, I do. You'll need to take two buses. 
 Which bus should I take first?
My laptop is so slow. 
 Buy a new one. 
 I would if I had the money.
Why are you holding your mouth? 
 I think I cracked a tooth. It hurts so much. 
 Did you look in the mirror?
Do you listen to the radio? 
 I listen day and night. 
 What do you listen to?
I'd like to order room service, please. 
 What would you like to order? 
 I'm really hungry. What are my choices?
This floor is falling apart. 
 How can you tell? 
 Are you kidding me? Step over here.
Why are you taking this class? 
 I need it to transfer. You? 
 Me too! I would never take Speech 101 if I didn't need it.
I'm so bad at picking out gifts for my husband. 
 The eternal question of what to get for the man who has everything. 
 What do you suggest?
$140. I can't believe it. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I got a ticket downtown for $140.
Did you hear about the ball player? 
 The home run hitter on drugs? 
 He said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
So, how much is the ticket going to cost? 
 Well, it's going to be $200. 
 $200 for a parking ticket?
My grandma's apartment smells funny. 
 So does mine. 
 I think it's an old people's smell.
I got accepted to all of the schools I applied to. 
 Congrats! You totally deserve it. 
 How many schools did you apply to?
Hey, Richard, I could sure use your help. 
 What is it, Jerry? 
 I can't seem to land an interview.
Look! The bus is coming! 
 Let's see if we can cross the street in time to catch it. 
 I don't think we are going to make it.
Greetings, neighbor. How's it going? 
 Hello to you! It's going just fine. Welcome to the neighborhood. 
 Thank you. How long have you been living here?
People are funny. 
 They sure are. 
 Did you hear about the pilot?
You need to try harder in school! 
 I am doing well in school. 
 Then why are your marks in science so low?
Can you teach me to swim? 
 Why don't you take a class instead? 
 Swim classes are embarrassing.
Good morning. How are you today? 
 I'm doing well. Thank you. 
 Are you here for our workshop today?
I'm a good card player. 
 Why is that? 
 Because I watch the other players.
Do you go to college? 
 Yes, I do. 
 What college do you go to?
So, how much is the ticket going to cost? 
 Well, it's going to be $200. 
 $200 for a parking ticket?
I'm calling because I got the invitation to your party in the mail. 
 I was worried that maybe it got lost. 
 No, it came in the mail yesterday.
Good Morning! EDD, how can I help you? 
 Hello, I recently lost my job. Can I file for unemployment? 
 Yes, you certainly can.
Is this Gage Avenue? 
 No, this is Florence Avenue. 
 Oh, no. I must've gotten off the bus too early.
I think I'm going to head home. 
 Already? It's only midday! 
 I think I have a fever.
You seem a little lost. Can I be of some assistance? 
 That would be nice of you. I just have one question. 
 You can ask as many as you want.
I've run out of money for my iTunes! 
 You used it all up already? 
 I bought my favorite artists' albums today.
Why are you taking this class? 
 I need it to transfer. You? 
 Me too! I would never take Speech 101 if I didn't need it.
What happened to your car? 
 I got a dent in the parking lot. 
 How did you get it?
Why do I have a negative balance in my checking account? 
 This means you used more money than you actually had in your account. 
 So what do I do now?
Help, please. My key won't open the front door to my apartment. 
 Oh, no. Let me try to help you. 
 Thank you, but I don't think there's much you can do.
I hate to go outside. 
 Me too. 
 Why do you hate to go outside?
What are those men doing with brooms? 
 I think those are special brushes. 
 Are they going to clean the ice?
My parents go to church every Sunday. 
 They trust in God. 
 They hope they will go to heaven.
Let's discuss the security deposit. 
 Do you have the full amount for the deposit? 
 I think I do. How much was it again?
Take off your shoes and walk in the sand! 
 I'd rather not. I bought swim shoes. 
 That's no fun!
Do you know why I stopped you? 
 No, officer. Why? 
 You failed to stop at the stop sign.
What is there to eat? 
 I don't know. Look in the fridge. 
 I think I'll make a sandwich.
Good morning. How are you today? 
 I'm fantastic. How about yourself? 
 That's great! I'm good, but I feel a little sick.
Let's book a trip to Puerto Rico. 
 There are so many online services that let us book from our computer right here at home. 
 How will we know we're getting a good deal though?
I am so hungry. 
 Why don't you heat up a TV dinner? 
 I'm tired of eating frozen food!
Do you like baseball? 
 I've never watched a game. 
 You've never even seen it on television?
Are you locked out of your apartment? 
 It appears that I am. 
 Did you forget your key inside your apartment?
My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table. 
 Why was that? 
 I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.
Why are you eating another apple? 
 You know what they say about apples! 
 No, I'm afraid I don't know.
Greetings, neighbor. How's it going? 
 Hello to you! It's going just fine. Welcome to the neighborhood. 
 Thank you. How long have you been living here?
Life is hard. 
 It sure is. 
 I thought school was hard.
Let's go to the mall. 
 What for? 
 I would like to buy a new sweater.
Dad, I don't have my own car. 
 Your mom and I talked to you about this. 
 I wasn't paying attention.
Why is the guy behind me honking? 
 You are going too slow. 
 I am driving at the speed limit!
Be careful how you peel those potatoes! 
 What's so hard about peeling potatoes? 
 You're holding the knife wrong.
Hi sir. I have seen you a lot. 
 I come to this restaurant twice a week. 
 May I ask why?
Hey, where were you all afternoon? 
 I was working out at the health club! 
 You went to the gym?
Why did you throw snow at your brother? 
 It was a snowball fight. 
 He said that he didn't know you were playing.
Hey Alice, do you have a stapler I can use? 
 Of course I do. It's on my desk. 
 Thanks. Mine broke two weeks ago.
I have decided not to transfer. 
 Why not? You kept saying you wanted to. 
 I know, but it's so hard getting accustomed to a new school.
Can I check the apartment for any damages? 
 Absolutely, let me accompany you. 
 Did the previous tenant maintain the apartment well?
Election Day is next Tuesday. 
 Did you register to vote? 
 How do you register?
I'm sorry, but today's bus tour has been canceled because of the weather. 
 Now what am I supposed to do? 
 The hotel's concierge will be happy to find you tickets to a local theater production.
Have you checked your smoke detectors recently? 
 No, I wasn't even aware we had smoke detectors. 
 All the apartments are equipped with them. It's an essential safety feature.
Can you cut my hair a little differently this time? 
 Sure! How would you like it cut? 
 Well, last time it was a little too long.
Did you write a letter to grandma? 
 Yes, I did. 
 Did you tell her about school?
I lost my new pen. 
 Where did you lose it? 
 I don't know.
I hope this neighborhood is more to your liking. 
 Yes, it definitely is. 
 It's a little more money, but I think it's a great fit for you.
I love playing all of these old fashioned games! 
 Me, too! Too bad it's so expensive. 
 I wish they'd cost nickels instead of quarters.
Do you ever take public transportation to get around? 
 Before I frequently did. Not so much anymore. Why do you ask? 
 I wanted some information about the public transportation that is available in the city.
What are we having for lunch? 
 I'm making some sandwiches. 
 Can I make some lemonade to drink?
Beer is a powerful drug. 
 So are cigarettes. 
 Which would you prefer?
I don't like seeing so many police officers patrolling. 
 They're just trying to keep the city safe. 
 I think they just like giving people tickets.
When are we going to stop? 
 We'll stop at the next McDonald's. 
 How far away is that?
Hi! Is there a specific car you're looking for? 
 I'm looking for a convertible. 
 We have a wide selection right here.
May I have a table for three? 
 Of course. Here is your number. 
 About how long will it take you to call this number?
I found a new social networking site. 
 That's cool. What's it called? 
 It's called Tumblr. It's a blog site.
I gained so much weight because my college dining hall is all-you-can-eat. 
 It's called the "freshman 15." 
 What is that exactly?
Is there a gym in this hotel? 
 Yes, the fitness center is located on the third floor. 
 Is there a charge for me to use it?
Have you ever been to that popular hot dog stand? 
 No, I have not. 
 My friends said the hot dogs are really great.
Excuse me! I need a ticket. 
 You owe me a dollar. 
 I already put one in!
I love to watch "Judge Judy." 
 Is that a TV show? 
 Yes. It's on every afternoon.
Wow! Our order is sure taking long. 
 Yes, it is. It's been nearly 45 minutes now. 
 Well, maybe they're just very busy.
Is this table okay? 
 No, it's too close to the kitchen door. 
 How about this table?
What are some of the best things to see in this city? 
 If you want to go sightseeing, we have a tour that leaves from the hotel. 
 I'd rather explore the city on my own.
I don't know what to give my dad for Father's Day. 
 Why don't you give him a card? 
 I already bought a card, but I want to give him a present, too.
I want to buy my son a skateboard. 
 Do you know what kind of board he'd like? 
 I was thinking a basic board.
Do you like my new bicycle? 
 It looks very sporty! 
 It's a racing bike. I bought it so I could be in the triathlon.
Do you get PBS on TV? 
 Yes, everybody gets the Public Broadcasting System. 
 It puts me to sleep.
Excuse me, where can I find a dictionary? 
 What kind of dictionary would you like? 
 A bilingual dictionary would be nice.
Today is Friday the thirteenth. 
 That's a bad day. 
 It's supposed to be unlucky.
Are you sure you want to go to Seattle? 
 Yes, I am sure. 
 It's an eight-hour drive.
I have a date with Mary tomorrow. 
 Don't you have a date with Dorothy? 
 My date with Dorothy is at 12 p.m.
I'm going to take a nap. 
 You should unplug the phone. 
 That's a good idea.
I have a really bad headache. What do you recommend? 
 You can purchase some over-the-counter pain relievers in aisle 6. 
 Do I need a prescription for those?
Come inside my apartment! Make yourself feel at home. 
 Thank you for letting me visit you today. 
 It's always nice to meet extra tenants of the apartment.
Hello, this is my first time here. I could use some help. 
 Okay, I can help. What is it you want to do? 
 I need to use the database on your computer.
I missed my connecting flight to Washington D.C. 
 How did you miss your flight? 
 I was sitting in the airport bar and I lost track of time.
Did you see the police posters in the neighborhood? 
 I haven't seen them. What do they say? 
 They say not to leave anything valuable in your cars at night.
I'll pay the restaurant bill. 
 No, I'll pay. 
 You always pay. I'll do it this time.
What is that black goo you're carrying? 
 It's roofing tar. 
 Are you replacing your shingles?
Do any public buses run nearby? 
 Yes, in fact many buses do. 
 Can you tell me where I can catch them?
I'd like to buy some flowers for my best friend's birthday. 
 What is your friend's favorite color? 
 She loves the color pink.
I'm worried. 
 Worried about what? 
 I'm getting married.
Mom, I'm hungry. 
 Look in the fridge. 
 I'm looking. There's nothing to eat.
The floor to my apartment is badly damaged. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. How bad is it? 
 It's practically falling apart.
I can't read my book. 
 Turn on the light. 
 The light is on.
Did you finish the math project? 
 I have not started. 
 But it's due tomorrow!
You have not driven in a month. 
 I just like staying at home these days. 
 What is really going on?
Did you fasten your seatbelt? 
 It bothers my neck. 
 Just adjust the strap so it doesn't bother you.
That was such a rush. 
 What did you do? 
 It was my first time voting in an election.
I am going to get the meatloaf. 
 Get anything but the meatloaf. 
 What's wrong with meatloaf?
Hello, how can I help you? 
 I'm calling about your delivery service. 
 What seems to be the problem?
My ear is killing me. 
 What's the matter? 
 I was on a plane.
I'd like to make a withdrawal. 
 Will that be from your checking or savings account? 
 I don't have a savings account.
I'm looking for an apartment. Have you seen any apartments for rent? 
 No, I have not. I'll keep an eye out. 
 Thank you. That's very helpful of you.
Hello, this is Isabel Foster. 
 Hi, Isabel. Why are you calling? You can just come to my office. 
 I'm actually not in the office right now.
Why do you have so many full trash bags? 
 I had a party last night. I'm cleaning up now and tossing them away. 
 Wait! What are you doing?
You have so many portraits on your wall! 
 I love displaying all the pictures I've taken. 
 How do you hang all the picture frames?
It's been so long since I've seen you! 
 I know. You haven't changed a bit. 
 Oh, stop lying. I've gained a little weight.
I'm surprised to see you out running. 
 I want to join the track team next semester. 
 Is that why you're training so hard?
This is it. We can move in starting tomorrow. 
 No way! Really? 
 Yup. We cleared escrow. It's officially ours now.
I have never seen you before. 
 I am a new student. 
 Where are you from?
How smart are you? 
 I don't know. I think I'm average. 
 Did you ever take an IQ test?
I hate flying. 
 So do I. 
 A long time ago, flying used to be okay.
Have you gone to vote today? 
 I didn't even know there was an election. 
 Didn't you get the pamphlet?
I'm sorry to knock on your door at this late hour. 
 Is there something wrong? 
 It's just one minor issue I have to bring up with you.
Is this a clean restaurant? 
 Well, the tables and chairs look okay. 
 Okay, let's sit down.
Do you like my new car? 
 Yeah, but it's a little plain. 
 What should I do to make it less plain?
Can you help me get up the stairs, please? 
 Of course. What happened to your leg? 
 I broke it a week ago.
I would like to purchase the book for Sociology 130. 
 May I see your student ID? 
 I didn't know we needed it.
Having a new president will change the course of history. 
 Why do you say that? 
 Well, Obama was our first black president. Now we have our first woman.
Hey, Mr. Smith. Are you busy? 
 Not at all. What's going on? 
 I've been working with the company for 10 years.
Take out your student ID card. 
 Why do you need it? 
 If you show it to the driver, your ticket costs less.
I think this new place will work out great. 
 Why do you say that, Dan? 
 It seems there's so much nearby.
I have a date with an amazing girl tomorrow. 
 How did you meet her? 
 I bumped into her on the street.
Is your seatbelt on? 
 Of course, it is. 
 I can tell you're lying.
My back is killing me. 
 What did you do? 
 I got out of my car.
I don't get art. 
 Or artists. 
 They're in a different world.
Mr. Lee, the seller has made a counteroffer on his home. 
 He did not accept my original offer? 
 Technically he did, but he has conditions.
Don't pick your nose. 
 I wasn't picking my nose. 
 What were you doing?
I'm stuffed. 
 Of course you are. You ate everything on the table. 
 I don't like to eat leftovers.
I wish I were a bird. 
 I think being a cat would be better. 
 But birds can fly.
I don't have any clean laundry for tomorrow! 
 Well, you should do your laundry then. 
 Laundry is such a hassle!
I have to go to bed early. 
 Why? The night is still young! 
 I have a class at 7 a.m.
Excuse me. May I ask you a question? 
 Sure. What do you need to know? 
 Do you know where I can purchase a bus pass?
I would like to cash this check. 
 Did you endorse the check? 
 What does endorse mean?
People who live in California are crazy. 
 Why is that? 
 Because of all the earthquakes and fires.
I hope this neighborhood is more to your liking. 
 Yes, it definitely is. 
 It's a little more money, but I think it's a great fit for you.
Hello, I would like to buy a bus pass. 
 Do you have a card to use for your pass? 
 What kind of card do I need?
I want to go to the ball game. 
 Is there a game tonight? 
 Yes, it starts at 7 p.m.
Mom, can you buy me a laptop? 
 You are only 13. 
 Everyone in school has one.
I have a problem. 
 What is wrong? 
 I don't know how to use chopsticks.
I'm calling to see if the results of some tests I took are in? 
 I can check for you. Can I have your name, please? 
 Sure, my name is Willie Foster.
Did you call the manager? 
 Yes. He said he'd come over tomorrow. 
 Did he say what time?
I'm on a new diet. 
 What are you eating now? 
 I switched from pasta to potatoes.
I'm gaining weight. 
 How much have you gained? 
 Three pounds just this month.
Can I get you something to drink? 
 No, thanks. I just finished a whole bottle of water. 
 You won't mind if I have something then?
I think you're really pretty. 
 Thanks, that's nice of you to say. 
 Will you go out with me?
I don't know which class to register for. 
 You should pick the class you need. 
 I know I need a science class.
Can I please have a rum and coke? 
 You are going to have to wait until we take off and are at a cruising altitude. 
 I hate flying though, and I really need something to take the edge off.
I get so hungry during the day! 
 That's not good; you should eat more. 
 Maybe I'll start taking snacks to work.
My house is much too stuffy nowadays. 
 It's the hot weather. 
 I bought an air conditioner, but it doesn't help at night.
I would like to have a garden. 
 Planting a garden is a lot of work. 
 But then you grow beautiful flowers.
I want to make a complaint about the all-day bus tour I took yesterday. 
 I'm sorry you have a complaint. 
 I actually have a few complaints.
We have to babysit this afternoon. 
 Why can't we ever go out with mom and dad? 
 They say they need time away from children.
Can you please shut up? 
 Maybe if you ask nicely, I will! 
 This is a library, so you have to shut up.
What are those wipes for? 
 You use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart. 
 That's a great idea.
