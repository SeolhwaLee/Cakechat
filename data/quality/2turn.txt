 You used it all up already?
 Why are you taking this class? 
 I need it to transfer. You?
 What happened to your car? 
 I got a dent in the parking lot.
 Why do I have a negative balance in my checking account?

 Get anything but the meatloaf.

 Not at all. What's going on?
 Take out your student ID card. 
 Why do you need it?
 I think this new place will work out great. 
 Why do you say that, Dan?
 I have a date with an amazing girl tomorrow. 
 How did you meet her?
 Is your seatbelt on? 
 Of course, it is.
 My back is killing me.
